# Custom-GPT---Assignment-01
<h2>What are GPTs? What are features and use cases of custom GPTs?</h2>
<p>GPTs refer to "Generative Pre-trained Transformers," a type of machine learning model used for natural language processing tasks. These models are pre-trained on large datasets and can generate human-like text based on input prompts. OpenAI's ChatGPT, for example, is built on the GPT architecture.</p>
<h3>Features of Custom GPTs</h3>
<p>Custom GPTs allow users to tailor the behavior and functionality of GPT models to specific needs. Here are some key features:</p>
<ol><li>
Personalization: You can set specific instructions, tone, or style for how the GPT should respond.</li>
<li>Integration: Custom GPTs can integrate with APIs and data sources, allowing them to pull in real-time information or interact with other software tools.</li>
<li>Function Calls: They can be designed to trigger specific functions or code execution based on user prompts.</li>
<li>Custom Knowledge Base: They can be tailored to include or emphasize specific knowledge areas, making them more relevant to particular industries or tasks.</li>
<li>User Interface: Custom GPTs can come with a specialized user interface to enhance interaction, making them more user-friendly for particular use cases.</li>
<li>Memory: They can retain and recall information shared across sessions, allowing for more context-aware interactions.</li></ol>
<h3>Use Cases of Custom GPTs</h3>
<p>Custom GPTs can be applied in various scenarios, including:</p>
<ol><li>
Customer Support: Automating customer interactions, providing instant responses, and resolving common queries.</li>
